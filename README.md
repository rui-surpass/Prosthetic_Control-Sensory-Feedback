# Prosthetic_Control-Sensory-Feedback
This system is designed to provide lower limb prosthesis users with a natural, fluid, and bionic experience of motion control and sensory feedback. By integrating EMG (electromyography), IMU (Inertial measurement unit), plantar pressure sensors, and TENS(Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator), it achieves motion control and tactile feedback.
